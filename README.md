# ws2812_k64f
Code to use the WS2812 integrated serial LED drivers with Freescale's FRDM-K64F ARM M4 dev board.

A lot of this is pretty messy. Sorry about that.
I'll clean it up sometimes when I feel like it, but for the most part I'm just experimenting with using these things to put on my bike.

To use this you'll need the KSDK v1.3.0. I also use KDS 3.0 (Freescale's Eclipse-based IDE), but it should also work with make and gcc so long as you've got the SDK set up.
